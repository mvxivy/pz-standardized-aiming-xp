description=[i]Original description:
description=Project Zomboid has a soft cap on aiming. Meaning that at a certain level (lvl-5+), it lowers your XP gains to make leveling even harder.
description=This removes that soft cap, while also adding optional XP multipliers to aiming.
description=These extra multiplier options are in the escape menu in game, and require ModOptions.
description=This mod makes it possible to continue leveling Aiming Skill past level 5 and beyond![/i]
