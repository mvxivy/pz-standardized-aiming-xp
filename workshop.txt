description=[h3]How it works[/h3]
description=
description=[i]Original description:
description=Project Zomboid has a soft cap on aiming. Meaning that at a certain level (lvl-5+), it lowers your XP gains to make leveling even harder.
description=This removes that soft cap, while also adding optional XP multipliers to aiming.
description=These extra multiplier options are in the escape menu in game, and require ModOptions.
description=
description=This mod makes it possible to continue leveling Aiming Skill past level 5 and beyond![/i]

description=[*] *The mod should work for build 41, but I [b]haven't tested it[/b]. If you can test it and give feedback, that would be great.
description=[*] To build mod 41, you need [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2169435993]ModOptions[/url], as before.
description=[*] To build mod 42, you don't need ModOptions.

description=[h3]Conflicts[/h3]
description=• The mod conflicts with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3036878362]ATRO[/url]
description=Later, if ATRO does not lose its relevance, I will try to implement compatibility between mods.
description=[i]By the way, instead of ATRO I recommend trying the native shooting model that appeared in build 42.1. It works great for me.[/i]
